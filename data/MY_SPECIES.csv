"Papilio cresphontes","2014-09-26 00:00:00 -0600","Eastern Giant Swallowtail (Heraclides cresphontes)

26 September 2014: September 2014 was a good month for finding and documenting new butterflies we'd not previously observed even if they were nearly just outside our door. One of these new finds was the Eastern Giant Swallowtail (Heraclides cresphontes) which we present in this observation. This particular species was divided into two species a few years ago and one of the publications that references what occurred in great detail is offered in our sources for anyone to access if they'd like. There is now a Western Giant Swallowtail (Heraclides rumiko) (west of the Rocky Mountains basically in the United States) and the Eastern Giant Swallowtail.  But in Central Texas both forms of this beautiful butterfly occur including hybrids between the one and the other. The essay we reference below provides the field marks to look for that distinguish one from the other and the Heraclides rumiko is also generally smaller in size overall than the Heraclides cresphontes. What's even better said in the essay is that as with Nature generally, all of the several field marks have to be used together in order to arrive at the most accurate identification since there are variations and exceptions galore. A three percent genetic or DNA difference exists currently between the two forms or newly declared species of Giant Swallowtail. Nature will not be contained, restrained, or repressed. Rather its irrepressible tendencies will find a way to best express what it determines is needed; it is nonjudgmental. And so it is with this beauty of a butterfly that we encountered perched on a tree limb on the banks of Cooper Creek next to Avondale Park at the start of the fall season. Because of its indigenous presence in North America, Eastern Giant Swallowtail has earned the right to being an authentic resident of the Western Hemisphere. Avondale Park is administered by the City of Denton, Texas, and so is Cooper Creek, which is a minor tributary to the Elm Fork Trinity River.

Can't be 100% positive that this is the same giant swallowtail as in the previous observation.  i walked to the waterfall  and the to the spontaneous pond on escarpment...then headed back toward the pond   so maybe 40 minutes later   as i approached the previous location i observed this Giant swallowtail.   

Because there are two varieties that are very similar i felt this one needed to be by itself   unfortunately this one did not show me the outside of his wings


This giant swallowtail is difficult to differentiate between the eastern giant swallowtail and the western giant swallowtail

On one hand the black spot on the upper wing in the large yellow bar is consistent with the Eastern Giant Swallowtail. and the edge of the wing has a yellow half moon on the edge again consistent with the Eastern Giant Swallowtail.

On the other hand the with the number of yellow ""cells"" near the outer edge toward the bottom of the top wing is more consistent with that of the Western Giant Swallowtail and the markings on the back of the head are also more consistent with the Western Giant Swallowtail.

the lower wing also shows traits of both. and lacks the last yellow cell shown on both species. overall there are more traits of the eastern giant swallowtail than the western giant swallowtails so I will leave my ID as Eastern Giant Swallowtail for now.
